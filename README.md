# Vending Machine


For this project, our group designed a desktop application and a model of a vending machine that sells snacks and beverages. After successfully logging in, users can make choices and purchases utilizing a user interface that follows a predetermined set of rules. Also, we have admin logins that allow us to read, amend, and remove data as well as keep track of all the details, including purchases, payments, and user information. 

The basic components of a typical vending machine include a product dispenser, a payment mechanism, and a user interface. A list of the things that are offered is shown on the user interface as a consumer approaches the vending machine, allowing them to choose the item they want to buy. The customer must pay cash to buy the item after making a choice. If the transaction is successful, the payment system will validate it and start the dispensing procedure.
